# Interpretability Techniques

This notebook explores interpretability of machine learning models using white box (ridge regression) and black box (random forest regression) approaches on the diabetes dataset. It showcases local and global interpretability techniques, including feature importance analysis and SHAP values, highlighting instances where the black box model outperforms the white box model in prediction accuracy.

### Conclusion: 

The analysis underscores the trade-off between interpretability and performance. Although the black-box model outperforms the white-box model in terms of predictive accuracy, the white-box model offers more consistent interpretability both globally and locally. Understanding this trade-off is crucial for choosing the appropriate model based on the specific requirements of the task at hand.
